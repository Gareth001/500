500 Card Game Online
=======

## Features
* Command line implementation of 500
* Online gameplay, play with your friends across the internet
* Very lightweight with only a 23kb download
* Fully implemented 500 functionality, such as enforcing following suit, misere and scoring
* Play with or against bots! Or even watch 4 bots battle it out! Similar in difficulty to an average 500 player
* 500 is now multiplatform!

## Compiling
Requires at least `gcc` and `make`. Can be compiled on Windows with MinGW + MSYS.
1. Download and unzip the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/Gareth001/500/releases)
3. Compile in 500 directory with `$ make`

## Running
Server: `$ ./server port password [playertypes]` (or the cmd equivalent in Windows)

To play with bots, supply the optional playertypes string. This is a string of 4 integers, one for each of the 4 players. If the integer is 0, then a human will be put in that player slot. If the integer is larger than 0, a bot of that difficulty will be put in that slot. Max bot difficulty is currently 2, with level 2 being average player difficulty and 1 being a very bad player. For example, a playertypes string of `0110` means the first and fourth players will be humans, and the 2nd and 3rd players will be level 1 bots. A playertypes string of `2222` will play a full game of all level 2 bots.

Client: `$ ./client ipaddress port password username`

To connect to localhost, use ip address of `0.0.0.0` (in Windows, `127.0.0.1`).

## Input
Suits and Trumps are represented with the starting character of each trump, so **S**pades, **C**lubs, **D**iamonds, **H**earts, **N**o trumps in order from lowest to highest.
When betting, send a number between 6 and 10 followed by a character representing the trump. E.g. 7 No trumps is bet by sending 7N. Misere is bet by sending **MISERE** when the current bet is 7. Open Misere is bet by **OPENMISERE**, and can be bet any time.

Passing is done by **PASS**, betting finishes when all players pass (including the winner).

When choosing the joker suit if you won with a no trumps bet, send a single character representing the suit of the card.

Number cards are represented by their numerical value followed by the suit of the card. E.g. 8 of Spades is 8S.
Picture cards are represented by the starting character of the rank (**J**ack, **Q**ueen, **K**ing, **A**ce) followed by the suit, e.g. Ace of Spaces is AS.
Joker is represented by JOKER.
For the kitty and play rounds, just send a card by typing the card exactly as it appears in your deck.

Note: Server requires no input after starting.
