## Input
Suites and Trumps are represented with the starting character of each trump, so **S**pades, **C**lubs, **D**iamonds, **H**earts, **N**o trumps in order from lowest to highest.
When betting, send a number between 6 and 10 followed by a character representing the trump. E.g. 7 No trumps is bet by sending 7N. Misere is bet by sending **MISERE** when the current bet is 7. Open Misere is bet by **OPENMISERE**, and can be bet any time.

Passing is done by **PASS**, betting finishes when all players pass (including the winner).

When choosing the joker suite if you won with a no trumps bet, send a single character representing the suite of the card.

Number cards are represented by their numerical value followed by the suite of the card. E.g. 8 of Spades is 8S.
Picture cards are represented by the starting character of the rank (**J**ack, **Q**ueen, **K**ing, **A**ce) followd by the suite, e.g. Ace of Spaces is AS.
Joker is represented by JOKER.
For the kitty and play rounds, just send a card by typing the card exactly as it appears in your deck.

Note: Server requires no input after starting.
